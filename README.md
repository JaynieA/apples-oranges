## What's What
This code compares two strings - apples and oranges.

### Steps
- create basic file structure and readme - commit
- source my script

### To Do
Practice Git by trying to extend the code in some of the following ways:

- adding user input
- checking if the strings have white space before comparison

Do this by ```forking``` this repo and ```cloning``` it your machine.
